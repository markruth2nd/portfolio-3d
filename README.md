# portfolio-3d

The purpose of this project is to create my portfolio which I am looking to share with potential employers as this will be my most up to date porfolio and it will be using the latest packages that I have researched. This project will show my 2 previous projects from the bootcamp which I have completed in March 2023, first of which scored 95% and the second and last of which scored me 100%. That along with the weekly bootcamp challenges gave me a over all score of 97.15% which I would like to promote in the project as well as ensuring I maintain steady progress whilst using the latest packages and challenges out there.

After some extensive research for I have found some basic starter code in Github which I will add into my project by replacing the public and assets folders so that I have basic logo's and images as well as some 3D models to get my project started which I will replace as I code through the project.
